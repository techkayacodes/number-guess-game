# Number Guess Game

This is a JavaScript Script made to create a number guessing game that gives you 10 chances to choose between a number of 1-100. If you get it wrong 10 times, then you reset the game.

This project came from lessons on Mozilla Developer Network Docs --> The goal of this project was to understand the basics and first steps within the programming language, JavaScript. The first steps were to create the index.html file and along with the scipt.js file and linking them together. Then understanding basics including creating a variable, a function, for loops, while loops, data types in JavaScript, and more...


Then the next steps included was to Debug the Number Guessing Game because after a few attempts in the beginning the code gets a specific error (bug).
